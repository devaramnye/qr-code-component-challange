## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned today that I should avoid settings heights in my CSS as it loses responsivness. I tryed to start with Mobile-first workFlow but I still have some issues understanding if my current work is really Mobile-first workFlow

### Continued development

I am currently working on responsive coding. Currently doing the 21 challange from Kevinpowell. Day one started (03.08.2023) and already day one helped me extremly by understanding that CSS is responsive by default and we are mainly causing the problems of the responsive threatment of CSS.
